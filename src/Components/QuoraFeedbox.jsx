        <p>Is the 94.1 LPA salary in Bangalore too low for a 32-year-old software engineer?With a 94.1 LPA you can just breathe in Bangalore. You need minimum of 94.1 Cr per annum to live an average life in Bangalore. May be over 100 Cr. I am sorry but for buying an underwear in Bangalore costs around 50 lacs and you can merely buy just 2 annually within your package that too if you compromise in everything and take loan from your friends. How are you still managing? ðŸ¥ºSome small questions for you. Which company is paying you a monthly salary of over 7 Lacs per month and it would be great if you can share your point of views .</p>
